This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

(a)(i + ii)
```{r}
labs
mean(labs$WaitTime)
ggplot(data = labs) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = labs$WaitTime))
```

```{r}
table(labs$SvcSat)
ggplot(data = labs) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = labs$SvcSat))
```

(b)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
SvcStat <- as.numeric(labs$SvcSat)
cor(labs$AGE, SvcStat)
Gender <- as.numeric(labs$Gender)
cor(Gender, SvcStat)
```
# By applying the correlation function on the two variables, we can conclude that Age and Gener are negatively correlated to Service Satisfaction.

(c)
```{r}
cor(labs$WaitTime,SvcStat)
```
# We can conclude that wait time and service satisfaction are negatively correlated.

(d)
```{r}
BMI <- labs$WT / (labs$HT * labs$HT)
print(BMI)
TC <- as.numeric(labs$TC)
cor(TC,BMI)
```
# We conclude that there is a slight positive correlation between BMI and Total Cholesterol

(e)
```{r}
attach(labs)
BMI.lm = lm(BMI ~ AGE,SBP,TC)
AGE = 45
SBP = 135 
TC = 150
df = data.frame(AGE,SBP,TC)
predict(BMI.lm, df, interval="predict")
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
