This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
#(a)
```{r}
dc = c("Good", "Poor")
dp = c(3,4)
ca = c(7,2)
df = data.frame(dc,dp,ca)
complicationRate = df$ca / (df$ca + df$dp)
complicationRate
```

#(b)
```{r}
mat = matrix(c(3,4,7,2),2,2)
fisher.test(mat)
# ==> ACCEPT the null hypothesis that X,Y (diabetic control, diabetics control/absent) at the 0.05 level, namely that the odds of concluding the difference between the two rates is different for good and bad diabetic control
# Conclude that the odds in the rate of good diabetic control is 17 times the odds of poor diabetic control
```

#(c)
```{r}
tbl = table(df$dc,df$dp)
chisq.test(tbl)
#Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates'
#continuity correction
#data:  tbl
#X-squared = 0, df = 1, p-value = 1
#Given the small cell values in the contingency table, it is therefore unwise to use t-test.
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
